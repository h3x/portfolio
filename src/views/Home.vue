        <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
          My passion for developing software solutions started some years ago
          while I was working in London and was in need of a fun and rewarding
          hobby. I found I loved the process of designing and implementing my
          ideas. I began my bachelor of Computer Science soon after with a view
          to transition out of my electrical career into a software development
          role. My drive to excel at as well as work on personal projects has led
          me to become exposed to many technologies and stacks.
          </p>
          <p>
          In my electrical career I found I had an aptitude for leadership, with a
          senior position as site foreman for many projects, including well known
          and respected clients such as Roberto Cavalli, Harrods London,
          Selfridges London, Prada and Cartier. All of these projects were
          completed on time and on budget, despite requirements changes and
          other challenges. I also had the opportunity to design the lighting layout
          for the jewelry showcase at Cartier Selfridges as well as put forward
          ideas on the design of accent lighting in the Denim Studio, Selfridges.
          </p>
          <p>
          After 7 years of world travel, experiencing 36 countries across 3
          continents, I believe I have become a well rounded person open to new
          ideas and cultures. I also believe that with my unique travel experience
          and cultural understanding I would fit in well with any diverse team. With
          my determination, passion for software development and ability to
          adapt quickly to new and changing situations, I am able to overcome
          challenges with determination and utilising the team environment I find
          myself a part of.
